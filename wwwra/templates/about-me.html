<h3>WHO IS THIS BILL ARMSTRONG</h3>
<a name="Current"></a>  Bill Armstrong currently works as a Network Engineer in a design role on Charter Communications Application Oriented Networking and Network Security team. On a givin day you can find him performing lab testing or writing documentation in order to develop enterprise-wide, network security and\or application delivery standards. In his time at Charter he has designed\deployed a simplified (from the previous model) enterprise wide loadbalanced distributed AAA system (with a <em>slick</em> RDBMS replication system) as well as a simplified (again from the previous system of disarray) Enterprise wide SNMP standard. Bill is also the lead designer of layer 2/3 topology for Charter's new corporate Datacenter, this same design is presently being used as the model to forklift the existing corporate Datacenter(as funding allows). Due to the teams kudzu-like reach (being both application delivery and network security) Bill and his team are able\required to function as an advisory role to nearly all other Engineering and IT teams with regard to best practices be they network security or application delivery related.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Prior to his time at Charter, Bill worked at SAVVIS where he provided Tier 3 Network support for one of the top 3 Stock exchanges in America. In this environment there was extensive hands on experience with Cisco and Juniper routing and switching platforms: specifically Catalyst 6500 and 3750 series switches as well as&nbsp; Juniper M20 routers. As such the ability to both write and implement BGP/IS-IS routing, Multicast (PIM &amp; IGMPv2), Extended ACLs, L2/L3 VLAN and various other change management tasks were a cheif responsibility. Because this was an operational engineering position and due to the mission critical nature of the traffic the client was sending\receiving, accuratly troubleshooting at the packet level with tcpdump was a constant.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>After reading the above you must be wondering things like: </strong></em></p>
<p><kbd><em>&nbsp; Should I continue reading this? What did Bill Do prior to that work at Savvis? Did he go to an Ivy League school? </em></kbd><kbd><em>How many seconds of silence are too many? </em></kbd><kbd><em>Why is this all written in third person? </em></kbd><br />
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Bill Armstrong, was born and raised as a child until adulthood at which point he found himself grown, THIRSTING&nbsp;to know more about the world than what had been provided him, via a standard secondary education, he embarked on a two year quest for knowledge at an <a title="ITT Tech, Bill's Alma mater" href="/web/20120615221506/http://www.itt-tech.edu/teach/list/it-cns.cfm"><strong>I</strong>nstitute of <strong>TT</strong>echnology</a> where he achieved moderately high marks in the majority of his classes.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp; Early on, while still a student, Bill found himself in dire need of both experience in the field in which he was pursuing as well as for riches. So like many great men before him Bill got REAL job. The world of front-line DSL technical support for home users was an eye opening and somewhat humbling experience. No matter how great he thought he was at navigating the insides of a desktop PC to install a PCI card or how clever his use of keyboard shortcuts on a Windows 95 machine was, when that task was to be relayed to and performed by someone&rsquo;s grandmother or in some cases to a relay operator who was themselves prepared to relay it again to the actual user via TTY Bill discovered rather quickly that knowing how to do things and how to say things were of equal importance. <br />
  &nbsp; Shortly after proving his worth Bill was awarded a glorious lateral move where he Supplied tier two support to the same pool of technicians he once was. In this role he was giving the ability to evaluate the line quality and transmission rates on high-speed data lines which helped him to better diagnose technical problems and communicate resolutions to the appropriate maintenance teams. It was in this role that Bill started grinding the raw block of steel that is now the business end of Battle-Axe-like technical documentation skills. It was through his newly found ability to distill, explain and document technical data that provided Bill access to the next pseudo-lateral move to trainer. As a trainer he was faced with the daunting task of having to expound fairly in-depth technical training to newly hired employees covering topics ranging from TCP/IP, ATM theory, Multiplexing and Router Configuration, to Mac OS 7.6-10.2, PC and Apple Hardware and to of course Windows ad nauseum. Also covered in these classes were the basic soft skills, because everyone needs to know that 5 seconds of silence is 2 seconds too long.<br />
  &nbsp; Bill soon graduated from school and was able to leverage the numerous lateral moves under his belt as well as his new degree to prove to the Call Center management that he could manage a team of his former peers. And so young William became a MANAGER! With this new title and multiple cent raise Bill was now able to provide administrative support to a team of 25+ technicians, with his new powers he was granted the permission from his management to act as a specific point of contact for client escalations and as such deal directly with upset customers with little to no leverage to do anything about the customer problem! And most spectacular of all Bill was now allowed to perform audits on inbound calls to the helpdesk IN&nbsp;ORDER&nbsp;TO&nbsp;ENSURE&nbsp;QUALITY SERVICE.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp; Needless to say the completley <del>un</del>bridled power of low-level Call Center Management did not out weigh the persuite of further knowledge\experiance in the biz (nevermind the ability to regain ) and so when the opportunity presented itself our hero FOUND&nbsp;A&nbsp;NEW&nbsp;JOB. This was quite a departure for Bill because now he was able to apply actual HANDS-ON skills doing Desktop\Server support and PC&nbsp;repair&nbsp; with a side of customer support (on-site, phone, and through email). Bill was also&nbsp; Assist sales staff with computer system configuration process (i.e. inform them of compatibility issues, or recommend optimal configurations).He also provided in-house IT functions such as cabling, workstation support, print and fax server administration, and basic network maintenance. After roughly nine monts in to his new job things were looking up for Bill when without warning <em>TRADGEDY STRIKES! </em>Business had Slowed (author note: noticably looking back) however unbeknownst to the Armstronginator, HIS&nbsp;neck was one of the many centered squarly on the chopping block.
